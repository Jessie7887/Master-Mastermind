# Master-Mastermind

A Program that prints that plays a simplified version of the game 'Mastermind'
This a modified version of a school project.

In a basic sense, it is a color guessing game where the computer will generate 4 colors
and the user has to guess what those colors are exactly as the computer generated them.

See if you have a Master Mind to figure it out.
